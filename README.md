# 👋 Hi there, I'm Neel!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Security-focused Full-Stack Engineer** who enjoys building secure, scalable, and high-performance web applications.

Over the years, I've worked on everything from **lightweight full-stack side projects** to **large-scale enterprise applications** and  **security tools**. I have led the system design and architecture across all these projects. My work spans backend APIs, frontend interfaces, infrastructure automation, and implementing security best practices across the stack.


With a passion for both development and defensive programming, I specialize in designing full-stack systems that are not only user-friendly but also hardened against modern threats. From creating responsive UIs to architecting secure APIs and infrastructure, I bring a security-first mindset to every part of the stack.
